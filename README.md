# pelotonR
This repository contains a collection of scripts for working with the Peloton API. 

The main script is app.R which contains a Shiny App to display:

* Live ride data - charts for output, resistance, cadence, and speed over the course of the live ride.

* Historical workout data - output over time, favorite days to workout, and week over week performance history.

Currently under development is a "Spotify Wrapped" type app that will allow a user to see summary statistics about their last year of workouts with Peloton. Work on this project is located in the "PelotonWrapped" folder. Planned developments include:

* Adding a tab for cycling stats (output over the year, total distance cycled, favorite class type)

* Word cloud of words used in class descriptions

* Ability to save an output that users can share on social media

* Format numbers as thousands properly where applicable (ex: 1,000 vs 1000)
